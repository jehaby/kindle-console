## Problem description ##


We have file `My Clippings.txt`, which is plain text file representing users highlights. We need to parse it, compare Highlights with that which is already stored in our database, and, if needed we need to add new Highlights to database.


So.


Parse File


Create Collection.


Add new Books, if needed. 






## Books (TODO!!!)  ##



Parse file. Create books array!
Look at KindleBookCreator!
